The classroom has a lot of students so a different colour on the slideshow headings, something darker than yellow, would increase the legibility of the font.   </li>
<li>
  All of the information provided was great, but if the group slowed down their speaking it would be a lot easier for the audience to follow.</li>
<li>The examples given by the group were great because they allowed the audience to fully understand their assignment.</li>
<h2>Chicken Mingle Feedback</h2>
<li>The dark red heading placed on the red background makes it illegible. A lighter background or lighter font would make the words pop.</li>
<li>If you narrowed down the amount of colours on the webpage, then you can focus your audienceâ€™s eyes to specific sections of the webpage.</li>
<li>A decorative font type would help draw the eyes to the navigation bar.</li>
