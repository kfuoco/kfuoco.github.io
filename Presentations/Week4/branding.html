<h1> Competitors</h1>
<h2>Brands</h2>
<p>
  List of Competitors:
-	Lindt
-	Godiva
-	Purdys
-	Hersheys


</p>

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
<p>
  Lindt, Godiva and Purdys are all known to be very prestige chocolate brands. Their chocolate is a nice and elegant gift. <br />
  Their high end chocolate comes with a high price as well. This can be seen as a weakness as they cannot compete with lower <br />
  price chocolate, so they are targeting a different type of audience. Another weakness is that they are not available at as <br />
  many stores. This can also be a strength because it makes them be perceived as more exclusive. Companies like Hersheys can <br />
  also be seen as a competitor. They offer lower quality chocolate at low prices. A strength of Hersheys is that they offer <br />
  very affordable chocolate and can be bought almost anywhere. Their weakness is that the quality of products is inferior to <br />
  other brands.

<h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
<h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
<p>
  The inspiration for my logo came from a combination of the brand name, the brand colours and the brand’s commitment to free <br />
  trade ingredients. I believe that Parrot Chocolatier’s free trade aspect is a big part of what will allow them to stand out <br />
  from their competitors, so I knew it was important to incorporate that into the logo. Behind the parrot, the background circle<br />
   includes the trademark logo for free trade ingredients. Additionally, I made the colour of the free trade symbol gold, one of <br />
   Parrot Chocolatier’s colours. The colour red was used to add some colour to the parrot. The parrot is black and white besides <br />
   a pop of colour in its wing. Finally, the writing is a simple font in light blue. The simplicity of the font reflects Parrot <br />
   Chocolatier’s brand as they are not dedicated to anything fancy or luxurious, but free trade initiatives.<br />
